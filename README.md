There are given 2 projects which I made them while I was learning basics of programming with Python at the platform "https://www.mohirdev.uz".  
1. In the first project, there are given 3 functions: 2 of them ("get_word" and "display" functions) are used while running main function and the third function is main function which is called to play the game.  
 - As a result of get_word function, we can get words without "-" or " "(space). This function randomly takes word from "words" list of "uzwords" file. File has been uploaded here.
 - Second function creates visual interface for players which letter of the word they found. If they find true letter, it will be displayed; else, "-" will be displayed.
 - The main function "suz_top_uyini" calls both of above functions, and if player (do not) finds true letter, it will (not) be displayed in screen; when entered a letter, it will be added in list "user_letters". If player enters the same letter again, game says "Bu harfni oldinam kiritgansiz. Iltimos boshqa harf kiriting:(You have entered this letter before. Please enter another:)". If player wants to stop the game, he should write "STOP" and result is "Afsus siz bu so'zni topa olmadingiz ):" or (Unfortunately you couldn't find word.). At the end of the game, if player finds all of letters true, the game will be stopped and congrats player: "Tabriklayman siz {word} so'zini {len(user_letters)} ta urinish bilan topdingiz!".
